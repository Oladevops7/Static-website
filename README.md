# s3Bucket
Welcome to my Terraform project! 
This project is all about automating the deployment of a static website on AWS S3. With Terraform, I've set up an S3 bucket that comes with specified ownership and access control lists (ACLs) to ensure everything is secure and access is well-managed.

Here's what it does: the project creates an S3 bucket with the right permissions and ownership settings, so you don't have to worry about manual configurations. Then, it uploads your static website files, including the index page, error page, and images, directly to the S3 bucket.

By using Terraform, I ensure the deployment process is consistent and efficient, making use of infrastructure as code principles. This means you get all the benefits of AWS S3's robust and scalable storage capabilities with a streamlined setup.

Whether you're working on a personal project or a professional one, this setup simplifies hosting static content while enhancing security and management. I hope this makes your development process smoother and more enjoyable!
